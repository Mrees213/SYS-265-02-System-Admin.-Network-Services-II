I think the lab was far more difficult than needed by having the DNS point at the firewall instead of the Active Directory or Domain Controller  because it made it extremely difficult for the wks and mgmt to join the domain. It took a lot of troubleshooting before realizing that if I had the DNS serves pointed at the domain controllers instead of the firewall, it would allow the wks and mgmt to actually join the domain. I think if that were more specific, I wouldn't have wasted that much time in the lab.  Other than that, the lab seemed somewhat easier than other labs with implementation, with most of it being part of old labs that I've worked on before.  Another issue I encountered, in the beginning, was that when I first booted up ad01, I couldn't change the administrative password, so I had to reboot the machine and wait for a while before I could change the password. 




GUi was a term I was unfamiliar with originally, which caused some difficulty for me in figuring out what it is and using context clues to guess what gui means.
