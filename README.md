I think the lab was far more difficult than it needed to be by having the DNS point at the firewall instead of the Active Directory or Domain Controller  because it made it extremely difficult for the wks and mgmt to join the domain. It took hours of troubleshooting before realizing that if I had the DNS serves pointed at the domain controllers instead of the firewall, it would allow the wks and mgmt to actually join the domain. I think if that were more specific, I wouldn't have wasted that much time in the lab.  Other than that, the lab seemed somewhat easier than other labs with implementation, with most of it being part of old labs that I've worked on before. 




GUi was a term I was unfamiliar with originally, which caused some difficulty with me having to figure out what it is and having to use context clues to guess what gui means.
