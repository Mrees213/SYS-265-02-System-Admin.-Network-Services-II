I think the lab was far more difficult than it needed to be by having the DNS point at the firewall instead of the Active Directory or Domain Controller  because it made it extremely difficult for the wks and mgmt to join the domain. It took hours of troubleshooting before realizing that if I had the DNS serves pointed at the domain controllers instead of the firewall, it would allow the wks and mgmt to actually join the domain. I think if that was suspfieves I don't think I would have to waste that much time on the lab. 




GUi was a term I was not familiar with and originally which caused some diffcult with me having to figure out what it is.
